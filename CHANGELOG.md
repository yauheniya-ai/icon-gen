# icon-gen-ai – Changelog

## 0.4.10

### Fixed
- **CLI: Consistent error messaging** - `search` command now shows the same installation instructions as `providers` command when AI extras are not installed

### Changed
- **CLI: Removed emoji from error messages** - Removed red cross emoji (❌) for better terminal compatibility

## 0.4.9

### Fixed
- **AI: Fixed provider detection** - Now correctly checks if third-party packages (`anthropic`, `openai`, `huggingface-hub`) are actually installed, not just if provider modules exist. This fixes the issue where `icon-gen-ai providers` incorrectly showed providers as available when AI extras weren't installed

## 0.4.8

### Fixed
- **CLI: Clarified installation steps in messages** - Commands now clearly separate "install extras" from "configure API keys" steps. Messages emphasize installing `pip install "icon-gen-ai[ai]"` first, then configuring API keys
- **CLI: Improved `providers` command output** - Now shows "✓ AI extras installed" status line before listing available providers

### Changed
- **CLI: Updated error message formatting** - `search` command error now explicitly states "AI extras installed but no API key configured" when extras are present but unconfigured

## 0.4.7

### Added
- **Tests: Comprehensive mocked unit tests for AI providers** - Added 29 new tests covering OpenAI (8), Anthropic (12), and HuggingFace (9) providers with mocked API calls. No real API keys required for testing
- **Tests: Improved coverage for AI modules** - Provider coverage: Anthropic 21%→87% (+66%), OpenAI 24%→72% (+48%), HuggingFace 18%→42% (+24%)

### Fixed
- **CLI: Improved `providers` command messaging** - Now provides clear, actionable guidance when AI features are not installed or configured:
  - When AI extras are not installed: Shows explicit instructions to run `pip install icon-gen-ai[ai]`
  - When no API key is configured: Lists all supported API keys (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, HF_TOKEN, OPENAI_API_KEY) with instructions on how to set them
  - When provider is active: Shows the active provider name and model
- **CLI: Updated `search` command error messages** - More descriptive errors that mention all three supported providers
- **Documentation: Added API key configuration guide** - README now includes instructions on how to configure API keys after installing AI extras

### Changed
- API keys are now listed alphabetically in all CLI messages (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, HF_TOKEN, OPENAI_API_KEY)
